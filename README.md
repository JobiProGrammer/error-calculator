# Physics Error Calculation Library

This library was made for every depressed physics student who gets confused with the amount of stupid error-prone work that one has to perform for error calcuation. My you have already thought if there isn't a way to do this autmoatically: Yes, there is. This library does the error calcuation fully automatically and even gives you the latex code back.
You shouldn't be busy by writing down some latex formulars, but instead focusing on the important stuff at your report
So, that you can focus on the important part of your report instead of writing down derivatives of formulars in latex taking you hours.
